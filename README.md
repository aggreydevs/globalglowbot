# Global Glowbot!

Global Glowbot is a game about a luminous electronic creature. Some say Glowbot is a sentient being, but one thing is clear. This android lights up at the thought of travelling the world. The answers to the game are cities around the world.


To play, simply hit the reset game button. 

The goal of the game is to find the mystery letters that make up the word
There are no spaces
If you get the letter correct, the letter is added to the board
If you get the letter wrong, the robot grows. 
Get 9 tries wrong, and you will have fried our dear robot friend.
Hit reset to try again.

Good Luck!
